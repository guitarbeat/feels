# System Patterns: FEELS

## Architecture Overview
FEELS uses a modular, component-based architecture with a clear separation between the core platform, learning content, and user data. The system employs a client-server model with significant client-side processing to enable interactive learning experiences even with intermittent connectivity.

## Key Components
- **Learning Engine**: Manages content delivery, progression logic, and assessment
- **Code Execution Environment**: Sandboxed runtime for user code with inspection capabilities
- **Feedback System**: Analyzes code submissions and provides contextual guidance
- **Progress Tracker**: Monitors and stores user advancement through learning paths
- **Content Management System**: Tools for creating and updating learning materials

## Design Patterns
- **Component Pattern**: UI built from reusable, isolated components
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven system for real-time feedback and updates
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable assessment strategies for different content types
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic creation of learning modules based on user progress
- **Proxy Pattern**: Secure access to execution environment and backend services

## Data Flow
User interactions trigger events that flow through the component hierarchy. Code submissions are processed through the execution environment, analyzed by the feedback system, and results are stored in the progress tracker. The learning engine uses this data to adapt content delivery and recommend next steps.

## Technical Decisions
- **Client-side Rendering**: Provides responsive UI and reduces server load
- **Progressive Web App**: Enables offline functionality and native-like experience
- **API-first Backend**: Facilitates multiple frontends and third-party integrations
- **Event Sourcing**: Captures all user interactions for detailed progress analysis
- **GraphQL API**: Efficient data fetching tailored to specific component needs
