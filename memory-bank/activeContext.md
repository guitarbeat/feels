# Active Context: FEELS

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and core architecture implementation. Currently establishing the Memory Bank documentation system and defining the foundational structure of the application.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: [Current Date] - Created core documentation structure
- **Project Structure**: [Current Date] - Defined initial file organization and architecture

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic project scaffolding with React and TypeScript
2. Implement core UI components and design system
3. Create prototype of the code execution environment
4. Develop initial learning module structure
5. Set up authentication system

## Active Decisions
- **UI Framework Selection**: In Progress - Evaluating between custom components vs. Material UI vs. Chakra UI
- **Code Execution Approach**: In Progress - Researching sandboxed evaluation vs. WebAssembly vs. server-side execution
- **Learning Content Format**: In Progress - Defining schema for lesson content and exercises

## Open Questions
- How will we handle offline code execution securely?
- What's the best approach for storing user progress that balances detail and performance?
- How granular should skill tracking be within the learning paths?
- What level of customization should we allow in user learning paths?
